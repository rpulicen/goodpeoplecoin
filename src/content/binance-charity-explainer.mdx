# How Binance Charity Tracks Funds On-Chain

Binance Charity represents one of the most successful implementations of blockchain technology for charitable transparency. This case study examines how Binance Charity uses on-chain tracking for donor accountability and what lessons other crypto charity projects can learn from their approach.

## Overview of Binance Charity

Launched in 2018, Binance Charity has become one of the largest crypto-native charitable organizations, processing over $150 million in donations and supporting humanitarian projects in more than 60 countries.

### Core Mission

Binance Charity aims to:
- Achieve 100% donation transparency
- Reduce intermediary costs to zero
- Enable real-time fund tracking
- Support global humanitarian causes
- Demonstrate blockchain's social impact potential

## The Blockchain Transparency Model

### How It Works

Binance Charity built its platform on several key principles:

**1. Public Wallet Addresses**

Every project has a dedicated wallet address published on:
- Binance Charity website
- Project pages
- Impact reports
- Social media announcements

This enables anyone to verify donations and spending on the blockchain.

**2. Zero-Fee Model**

Unlike traditional charities that take 5-30% for operations:
- 100% of donations reach projects
- Operational costs covered by Binance
- No hidden fees or markups
- Maximum impact per donated dollar

**3. Real-Time Tracking Dashboard**

Donors can:
- See their donation on-chain immediately
- Track fund deployment to beneficiaries
- Verify impact claims independently
- Receive updates on project progress

**4. Multi-Chain Support**

Binance Charity accepts donations on:
- Binance Smart Chain (primary)
- Ethereum
- Multiple other networks
- Various cryptocurrencies

## Case Study: COVID-19 Relief Campaign

- Transfers to distribution partners
- Final delivery to hospitals

**Step 4: Impact Reporting**

## Comparison to Traditional Charity Models

### Traditional Charity Approach

**Donation Flow**:
1. Donor → Charity HQ (takes 15-30% overhead)
2. Charity → Local partner (takes 10-20% overhead)
3. Local partner → Beneficiary (actual impact: 50-75% of donation)

**Transparency**:
- Annual reports (often delayed 6-12 months)
- Aggregated numbers (can't verify individual donations)
- Limited detail on spending
- Trust-based, not verifiable

### Binance Charity Approach

**Donation Flow**:
1. Donor → Project wallet (0% fees)
2. Project wallet → Beneficiary (100% of donation reaches cause)

**Transparency**:
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Individual transaction verification
- Complete spending detail
- Blockchain-verified, not trust-based

### Impact Comparison

For a $1,000 donation:

**Traditional Charity**:
- Administrative costs: $150-300
- Partner fees: $70-140
- Actual impact: $500-780
- Verification: Take charity's word

**Binance Charity**:
- Administrative costs: $0
- Partner fees: $0
- Actual impact: $1,000
- Verification: Check blockchain
